# Income-Prediction-Model

This repository implements an XGBoost classifier for predicting income levels (<=50K or >50K) using the Adult Income dataset.
Key features include Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and model evaluation.
Accuracy improved from 0.8770 (initial XGBoost) to 0.8810 after optimization and SMOTE implementation.
